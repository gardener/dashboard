# Working with Service Accounts

## Prerequisites

- You are logged on to the Gardener Dashboard
- You have [created a project](working-with-projects.md).

The cluster operations that are performed manually in the dashboard or via `kubectl` can be automated using the [Gardener API](https://gardener.cloud/api-reference/). You need a **service account** to be authorized to perform them.

> The service account of a project has access to all Kubernetes resources in the project.

## Create a Service Account

1. Select your project and choose *MEMBERS* from the menu on the left.
  
2. Locate the section *Service Accounts* and choose *+*.

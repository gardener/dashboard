# Configure Vendors and Custom Cloud Providers

## Motivation
Gardener landscape administrators should have the possibility to change icons and names of vendors (cloud providers, image vendors, etc.). This enables the administrator to adjust vendors and apply company or context-specific values. An example of use could be a locally hosted OpenStack infrastructure that should appear as `MyCustomCloud` with a custom icon in the Dashboard, so that the user immediately identifies it as `MyCustomCloud` as they might not be familiar with the term `OpenStack`.

## Vendor Configuration
It is possible to change the name and icon of built-in vendors in the Gardener Dashboard (e.g., AWS, Ubuntu, etc.) when using the [helm chart](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/blob/master/charts/gardener-dashboard) in the `frontend.vendors` map. You can add a key for each vendor that you want to customize. The key equals the vendor type. The following configuration properties are supported:

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `name` | Display name of the vendor |
| `icon` | Asset name as defined in the vendor asset map. You can also use the [data:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/http/basics_of_http/data_urls) scheme for development. For production, it is recommended to provide static assets |

Besides overwriting built-in vendors, you can also add additional vendors that the Dashboard does not (yet) have built-in support for. For example, additional machine image vendors or a cloud provider that you have defined via [cloud provider configuration](#configure-available-cloud-providers).

## Configure Available Cloud Providers
The Gardener Dashboard has a list of built-in cloud providers:
`'aws', 'azure', 'gcp', 'openstack', 'alicloud', 'metal', 'vsphere', 'hcloud', 'onmetal', 'local'`

The Dashboard renders available cloud providers in the order defined by the list.
> **_NOTE:_**  A cloud provider is considered `available` if at least one cloud profile is defined for a Gardener landscape. If you add custom cloud providers, they will only appear if you have configured a cloud profile in your landscape.

You can overwrite the list by providing the `frontend.cloudProviderList` array using the [helm chart](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard/blob/master/charts/gardener-dashboard).
This way, you can change the order or hide cloud providers from the Gardener Dashboard by omitting them from the list. You can also add additional (custom) cloud providers. You can overwrite the appearance of the custom cloud providers via [vendor configuration](#vendor-configuration). For information on how to configure a custom cloud provider, see [custom cloud providers](#custom-cloud-providers).

## Custom Cloud Providers
Custom Cloud Providers are provider types already suppored by Gardener (Gardener Provider Extension exists) but that are not (yet) built into the Dashboard.
You can add custom cloud providers and define the secret dialog input fields as well as add a default shoot spec where you can provide values that are required for the shoot resource. You can also define input fields that are added to the `Infrastructure Details` section of the create cluster page. These fields can be used if a user needs to provide infrastructure-specific data for a shoot cluster. All values for the custom cloud provider can be configured using the helm chart in the `frontend.customCloudProviders` map. You can add a key for each vendor that you want to customize. The key equals the custom cloud provider type. The following configuration properties are supported:

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `zoned` | Defines if this cloud provider is zoned. If not provided, defaults to `true` |
| `shoot.specTemplate` | Add default `shoot.spec` template. The provided yaml values are added to each new shoot resource. The worker CIDR can be used as a variable `${workerCIDR}` |
| `shoot.createFields` | Define infrastructure-specific input fields for the create cluster page. See below for more details. |
| `secret.fields` | Define secret input fields. See below for more details. If not provided, defaults to plain yaml object input |
| `secret.help` | `HTML` secret dialog help content |

> **_NOTE:_**  It is currently not possible to add custom DNS Providers. Only infrastructure providers are supported.

### Custom Input Fields
It is possible to define input fields with data validation for the `Infrastructure Details` section on the create cluster page as well as for the infrastructure secret dialog. The array can contain field definitions with the following properties:
| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `key` | Unique key for the input field. Used as the secret data key if defined as part of infrastructure secret dialog. |
| `path` | Destination path in shoot spec for create fields. Only required for `Infrastructure Details` section. |
| `hint` | Input field hint. |
| `label` | Input field label. |
| `type` | Input field type. Supported values are detailed below. |
| `values` | List of values for the select input field. Details are provided below. |
| `validators` | Add a key for each validation. Each validator has a `type` property as well as additional properties depending on the type. See below for possible validation properties. |
| `validationErrors` | For each key defined in `validations`, add a key with an error message for the validation. |

### Type
Supported input field types include:

- `text`: Simple plain text input.
- `password`: Hidden secret data plain text input.
- `select`: List of values that the user can select.
- `select-multiple`: Allow to select multiple values from a list.
- `json`: Object data in JSON format.
- `yaml`: Object data in YAML input.

### Values
For the `select` and `select-multiple` input field, the list of values can be:

- `Array`: A simple list of values.
- `Object`: Use `{ cloudprofilePath, key }` - Source path in the cloud profile. If an object, use `key` to map values.


### Validators
| type | properties | description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `required` | `none` | Required input field |
| `requiredIf` | `not`: Optional array of field keys. Makes field required if one of the referenced input fields is empty. | Depends on other input field if required or not. Use `not` references to create *either or* scenarios, e.g., `username / password` *or* `token` is required |
| `regex` | `value`: JavaScript regex pattern | Input field must match the provided pattern. You can define arbitrary validations, e.g., length or specific syntax |
| `isValidObject` | `none` | Input value must be a valid object. Can be used for `json` and `yaml` field types to ensure valid data |

You can add an optional `message` property to all validators to provide a custom error message.

## Vendor assets
In the above example, the vendor icon is referenced as static asset. Static vendor assets can be provided in the `static/vendor-assets` folder using in the `frontendConfig.vendorAssets` map.

The files have to be encoded as base64 for the chart. For more information on how to provide assets using the chart, see [Logos and Icons](customization.md#logos-and-icons) section of customization documentation.

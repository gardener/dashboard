# Working with Projects

## Overview

Projects are used to group clusters, onboard IaaS resources utilized by them, and organize access control.
To work with clusters, first you need to create a project that they will belong to.

## Creating Your First Project

### Prerequisites
- You have access to the Gardener Dashboard and have permissions to create projects

### Steps

1. Logon to the Gardener Dashboard and choose **CREATE YOUR FIRST PROJECT**.

  > :warning: You will **not** be able to change the project name later. The rest of the details will be editable.

### Result

After completing the steps above, you will arrive at a similar screen:

## Creating More Projects

If you need to create more projects, expand the `Projects` list dropdown on the left. When expanded, it reveals a **CREATE PROJECT** button that brings up the same dialog as above.

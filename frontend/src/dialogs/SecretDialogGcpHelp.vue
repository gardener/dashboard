        A service account is a special account that can be used by services and applications running on your Google
        Compute Engine instance to interact with other Google Cloud Platform APIs. Applications can use service
        account credentials to authorize themselves to a set of APIs and perform actions within the permissions
        granted to the service account and virtual machine instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ensure that the service account has at least the roles below.
        <ul>
          <li>Service Account Admin</li>
          <li>Service Account Token Creator</li>
          <li>Service Account User</li>
          <li>Compute Admin</li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        The Service Account has to be enabled for the Google Identity and Access Management API.
      </p>

      <p>
